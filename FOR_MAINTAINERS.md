## Releasing a new version
To fully release a new version, you need to have access to the @materializecss organization on the npmjs. Then, please follow the steps below:

1. In your local copy of Materialize, step into the dev Branch with `git checkout v2-dev` and pull the newest version
   with `git pull origin v2-dev` to have the newest version. Run Tests and check if everything works.

2. Make a new Release branch with `git checkout -b release-2.X.X-alpha`.
   In case something happend or needs to be changed during the release it is better to keep the release on its own branch.

3. Run `npm run release -- --oldver=<current_version> --newver=<new_version>`
   What this command does is that it will replace any occurrences of "<current_version>" with the "<new_version>". So for example, if the current release is `1.0.0`, and then the planned release is `1.1.0`, the command would be
```npm run release -- --oldver=1.0.0 --newver=1.1.0```

4. Verify that version is correctly replaced in:
   * package.json
   * src\global.ts
   * the docs* correctly show the new version `npm run dev`

5. Add Commit with message "chore: release 2.X.X-alpha". Then push to server.

6. Create a Pull Request (PR) ([example](https://github.com/materializecss/materialize/pull/258) so that we can verify nothing goes wrong, address the feedback from the reviewers if there is any

7. Create a new (draft) release on GitHub
   * Generate the Release notes automatically
   * Upload the `materialize-v<new_vversion>.zip` from the bin-folder
   * Create a new tag together with the release

8. Merge the Pull Request after 3 days if there are no concerns and all checks passed.
   * Set the draft release to public.

9. Publish the release on npmjs
   * If you never logged in on npm, please do `npm login` first and enter your credentials
   * Then run `npm publish` and follow the instructions there

10. Done! Yay new version ðŸ¥³
